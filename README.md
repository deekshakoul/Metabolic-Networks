Defining the structure of Metabolic Networks:

Coded metabolic networks of 43 organisms of three basic types : Bacterium, Eukaryote, and Archae , they show properties of both modular and scalefree distributions and thus to resolve contradiction proposed a ‘hierarchical’ distribution, which aptly explained observations regarding clustering coefficient, degree distribution and diameter of network.
